# US-Weather-Data-Prediction-and-Analysis
Weather plays a critical role in shaping human activities, ecosystems, and economic outcomes. With the increasing impacts of climate change, understanding and predicting weather patterns has become a priority. This project aims to analyze historical weather data from the United States and predict temperatures for the next day and subsequent days. These forecasts provide valuable insights into potential weather conditions, aiding the general public and industries like agriculture, transportation, energy, and disaster management in making informed decisions and preparations.
In addition to temperature forecasting, the project offers a comprehensive analysis of weather events that occurred across the United States between 2016 and 2019. It explores year-over-year changes in weather phenomena, the duration of significant events, and the distribution of these events across states and cities. This analysis sheds light on how various regions are affected by extreme weather conditions, providing a deeper understanding of localized and nationwide climate trends.

Furthermore, the project emphasizes identifying trends and anomalies in weather patterns. By uncovering unusual phenomena, such as prolonged droughts, unseasonal temperature spikes, or shifting rainfall patterns, it highlights critical changes that may result from global or localized climate shifts. These insights aim to provide a clearer picture of how weather conditions are evolving and their implications for communities and ecosystems.

The ultimate goal of this project is to transform complex weather data into accessible, actionable insights. Policymakers, researchers, and businesses can leverage the findings to develop strategies for mitigating the risks posed by extreme weather events and adapting to long-term climatic changes. At the same time, the general public can benefit from improved awareness and preparedness, ensuring safety and resilience in the face of changing weather conditions.

By combining predictive modeling with historical event analysis, this project bridges the gap between data science and real-world applications. It provides a comprehensive tool for understanding, predicting, and adapting to the challenges posed by an increasingly dynamic climate.

Objectives:
•	Predict daily minimum and maximum temperatures.
•	Analyze trends in weather events like rain, snow, and fog.
•	Highlight geographical and temporal variations in weather patterns.
